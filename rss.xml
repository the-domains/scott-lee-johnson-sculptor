            <description><![CDATA[<p>Scott Lee Johnson was born in 1952 and raised in Connecticut, where he still lives.  He has been surrounded by the art world for most of his life.  His grandfather was Burt Johnson, a noted California sculptor, whose works still grace many public buildings and parks across the United States.  Sadly, his untimely death at the age of 37 cut short a very promising career.  Scott's great aunt was Annetta (Johnson) St Gaudens. She was married to Louis St Gaudens who was a potter. His brother was the renowned sculptor Augustus with whom Annetta worked on several projects.</p>]]></description>
